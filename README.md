## Installation
Download these files from this GitHub Repository and then type `npm i` in your terminal for the folder with said files. Afterwards, use the commands in my `schema.sql` (which can be found in the `db` folder) within mysql in your terminal. Then, exit mysql and in your regular terminal, type `node seeds/index.js` to seed the data into your database. You should now be good to run the code!

## Usage
Type `node index.js` into the same terminal you used for the installation (that was not mysql). You can then open up Insomnia to test the functionality of my code! Use the url `localhost:3001/api` followed by either `/categories`, `/products`, or `/tags` to get to working endpoints. You can also add on another slash followed by an id number to get specific categories, products, or tags. You are able to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE with all three, so have fun experimenting!
